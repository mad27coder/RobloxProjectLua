    "Appreciate the eye contact, even if your wallet didn’t feel the same.",
    "Some people just walk up, read everything, and vanish. Wild.",
    "That moment when someone gets close… then walks away.",
    "You came here like you had something to give. Guess not.",
    "People keep stopping like they're gonna donate… and don’t.",

    "You looked like you cared. It was cute while it lasted.",

    "Stopping here for fun, or just testing your self-control?",
    "You ever pause at a booth, then act like you didn’t feel anything?",
    "Booth caught your attention, but not your Robux, huh?",
    "It's always the ones who look the longest who give the least.",
    "I see a lot of people curious… but not generous.",
    "Some people just walk around collecting vibes. That you?",
    "You’re great at pretending you were just passing through.",
    "No worries, just another drive-by interest.",
    "It’s okay, this booth wasn’t flashy enough for you anyway.",

    "Was that a visit or just a random stare?",
    "If I got 1 Robux for every fake visit, I’d be rich already.",
    "You walked up like a hero, walked away like a rumor.",
    "Pausing here doesn’t count as supporting, but hey—nice effort.",
    "I call that a drive-by donation denial.",

    "You walked away like your presence was the gift.",
    "Appreciate you stopping by. Still broke, though.",
    "It’s wild how people pause like they’re thinking. Then leave.",
    "If staring paid Robux, I’d be stacked.",

    "You paused long enough to remind me why I keep trying.",
    "Was that a donation attempt or just dramatic pacing?",
    "Walked by again, huh? You must really enjoy disappointment.",
    "If you visit a booth and don’t donate, did it even happen?",
    "This booth has great visitor stats. Donation stats… not so much.",
    "Your curiosity is undefeated. So is your silence.",
    "Every walk-by leaves a footprint. And a bit of sadness.",
    "You were here. That’s something. Maybe next time it’ll be more.",
    "I don’t expect Robux. I just notice patterns.",
    "That moment when someone walks up and walks off... legendary.",
